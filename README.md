# Servings - Headstart

See also toothpaste (usage) calculator at https://www.omnicalculator.com/everyday-life/toothpaste

A table of how many servings a product serves (e.g., a tube of toothpaste serves 387 servings before it is empty).

Rooms here have been named by their purpose (e.g., dinning room). One room can fulfill more than one purpose, hence on does not need a physical, separate room for each purpose. Instead more that one purpose can be fulfilled by one room (e.g., Office and Utilities room).

Rooms (i.e. purposes) to consider are:

- Bedroom: [Redesign your bedroom](https://discoverdesign.org/challenges/redesign-your-bedroom)
- Clothingroom:
- Bathroom: 
- Living room:
- Dining room:
- Office:
- Kitchen:
- Washroom:
- Cleaning room:
- Utilities room:
